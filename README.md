## Core:
The application imitates a recipe book to which every user can take a look, add their own recipe, or save their favorite ones, made by the others. It makes cooking easier, by creating one place to store all the recipes so that you'll never forget the ingredients, their ratios, or the preparation of any meal. Moreover, you can always keep your recipes close to you, all in one app, so there's no need to take a large cookbook wherever you go (just in case) with tons of sheets and newspaper clippings.

## Features:
With the application, you can create and later manage your recipes, look at the others' recipes and save your favorite ones. Thanks to the ingredients API we use, it's super easy to track the nutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, or fats. Moreover, recipes may have tags, which later can help you with a dilemma about what to eat - we're going to offer you the most suitable meal based on the recipes you previously liked! \
And to make your experience with our app even better, you can also request sending an email with the recipe you want - this way it's even easier to share it with your friends or family.

## External API usage:
For the entire ingredients database, we use [EDAMAM Food Database API](https://developer.edamam.com/food-database-api).
